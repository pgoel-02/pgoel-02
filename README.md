## Hi, I'm Prashansa Goel 👋

I'm a software engineer from the Bay Area! I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from UC Davis in March 2024.

Here's a bit about myself and what I've been working on:

### 🏠 Personal Journey
After graduation, I spent most of 2024 traveling, continually learning through online courses and tech newsletters, and being with family, serving as the **primary caretaker** for my parent during a long-term hospitalization. Now, I'm currently working as a software engineer at a startup that's currently in stealth. 

### 🌱 Startup Ecosystem
I’m especially excited about the **startup world**. I had the privilege of doing a fellowship at **True Ventures**, an SF-based early-stage venture capital firm, and spent **1.5 years** doing web development for the firm. My work primarily involved **Ruby on Rails**, **Python**, and AI models like **Claude** and **GPT**, along with high-level design tasks for search functionality. I'm always eager to explore new ways to get involved with the startup ecosystem!

### 🧬 AI Research
I have over **2 years of AI research experience**, specializing in **bioinformatics**. My research focuses on developing AI optimization approaches in **Python** (using Pandas, cuDF, and PyTorch) for removing secondary haplotigs during diploid genome assembly and scaffolding. Through this project, I also gained experience with High Performance Computing (HPC) while scaling execution across multiple cores and Python multi-processing techniques to parallelize execution. 

### 💡 Self-Starter
During my time at UC Davis, I identified a gap in the Computer Science curriculum, so I **pitched, designed, and taught** a new algorithms class with **45+ undergraduate students** to fill that gap. I also served as **President** of a technical student organization (Google Developer Student Clubs @ UC Davis), growing membership by over **560%** in just one year and leading a team of 12. I’m eager to bring this same energy and drive in future projects.

### 📚 Hobbies/Personal Goals
Outside of work, I love reading (currently reading _The Overstory by Richard Powers_!). I have also always found comfort in writing, though I haven't published most of my pieces yet. This year, I'm pushing myself out of my comfort zone by starting a blog — a small step towards hopefully publishing a book in the future (one of my long-term goals). I also enjoy Pilates, Barre, and Yoga, with plans to get certified as a **Yoga Instructor** within the next few years!
