## Hi, I'm Prashansa Goel 👋

I'm a Computer Science graduate from UC Davis interested in **software engineering** and **AI**. Here's a bit about myself and what I've been working on:

### 👩🏽‍💻 Current Work
I'm currently building a **file-agnostic RAG solution** in Python, exploring innovative approaches to enhance data processing and integration. 

### 📝 Recent Projects
I most recently developed an **AI-powered Chrome extension** to promote active recall during educational YouTube videos, leveraging OpenAI's **Whisper** & **GPT-4** models, **React/JS**, **Flask/Python**, and **PostgreSQL** to deliver a seamless UX. 

### 🌱 Startup Ecosystem
I’m passionate about the **startup world**. I had the privilege of doing a fellowship at **True Ventures**, an SF-based early-stage venture capital firm, and spent **1.5 years** doing web development for the firm. My work primarily involved **Ruby on Rails**, **Python**, and AI models like **Claude** and **GPT**, along with high-level design tasks for search functionality. I’m eager to dive deeper into the startup ecosystem and contribute as an engineer to companies making a real impact.

### 🧬 AI Research
I have over **2 years of AI research experience**, specializing in **bioinformatics**. My research focuses on developing AI optimization approaches in **Python** (using Pandas, cuDF, and PyTorch) for removing secondary haplotigs during diploid genome assembly and scaffolding. Through this project, I also gained experience with High Performance Computing (HPC) while scaling execution across multiple cores and Python multi-processing techniques to parallelize execution. 

### 💡 Self-Starter
During my time at UC Davis, I identified a gap in the Computer Science curriculum, so I **pitched, designed, and taught** a new algorithms class with **45+ undergraduate students** to fill that gap. I also served as **President** of a technical student organization (Google Developer Student Clubs @ UC Davis), growing membership by over **560%** in just one year and leading a team of 12. I’m eager to bring this same energy and drive to a company working on exciting, impactful projects.

### 🏠 Personal Journey
After graduation, I spent most of 2024 traveling, continually learning through online courses and tech newsletters, and being with family, serving as the **primary caretaker** for my parent during a long-term hospitalization. Now that things have stabilized, I'm fully focused on my job search and eager to explore roles in Software Engineering and AI.

### 📚 Hobbies/Personal Goals
Outside of work, I love **reading** (currently reading *The Overstory* by Richard Powers!). Writing is also a passion of mine, and one of my life goals is to publish at least one book. For now, I’m working on starting a blog this year. I also do **Pilates**, **Barre**, and **Yoga**, with plans to get certified as a **Yoga Instructor** within the next five years!
